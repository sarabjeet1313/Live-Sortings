## Built With

While designing the Front-End, I have used some of the web frameworks and tools according to my needs.
Some of the used ones are:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Javascript library to build the front-end
- [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - It is one of the oldest React libraries and available as a npm package to download.
